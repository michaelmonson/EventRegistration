STRUCTURE:

This application makes use of Angular Seed, which is targeted towards smaller applications.  Good jumping off place for us, with basic tie-in's with node.js

SERVER:

A modified version of node.js, for serving simple Angular pages. For the purposes of this application, it offers great convenience.


DATABASE:

For the purposes of this exercise, we are simply writing to JSON-structured text files.  No database will be used.


INSPIRATION:

I created this application while working through a demo application by Joe Eames, who lives in the Salt Lake area.
