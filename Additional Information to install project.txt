In addition to instructions, I had to install:
grunt ~ npm insatll -g grunt
bower ~ npm install -g bower



Actually, bower may be optional.  Isn't it an alternative package manager to NPM?  Good to have on system though.

Additional Instructions (root):
 
  1. Download http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap/ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.1.0.js
  2. Include it in your index.html <script src="ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.1.0.js"></script>
  3. Declare your app with ui-bootstrap as a dependency angular.module("myApp", ['ui.bootstrap']);
  4. Enjoy!

We should put that in the readme too probably.
